# No AI Overview — Browser Extension

A lightweight browser extension that disables Google’s **AI Overview** by automatically redirecting all Google searches to the classic **Web** results view (`udm=14`).  
This mode is AI‑free, fast, and consistent — no injected summaries, no AI answers, no clutter.

This project is MIT‑licensed and currently in **beta**.  
Because Google frequently changes its search architecture, behavior may vary across browsers.

## 🚀 How It Works

Google recently integrated AI Overview deeply into the search rendering pipeline, meaning it’s no longer just a removable HTML block.  
Instead of fighting Google’s dynamic DOM, this extension uses a more reliable method:

### ✔ Automatically redirects all Google searches to the **Web** tab  
The Web tab (`udm=14`) uses Google’s legacy renderer, which **does not support AI Overview at all**.

So instead of hiding AI content, this extension prevents Google from generating it in the first place.

## 🧠 Why This Method Is Better

- No flicker or AI block appearing before removal  
- No need for MutationObservers or DOM scraping  
- Works even as Google changes class names or injection methods  
- Faster and more stable than trying to delete AI Overview elements  
- Works across all Google domains (with proper manifest configuration)

This is the closest thing to a true “AI Overview Off” switch.

## 🧩 Core Logic (remove_ai.js)

This is the entire redirect logic:

```js
// Redirect to the AI-free "Web" view
if (window.location.pathname === '/search' && !window.location.href.includes('udm=14')) {
  const url = new URL(window.location.href);
  url.searchParams.set('udm', '14');
  window.location.replace(url.href);
} 
``` 
This ensures every Google search loads in the AI‑free Web view.
